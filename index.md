# Welcome to the Carrots for DiTunes Charity ðŸ¥•

## About the Cause
DiTunes has been banned from delicious carrots for almost a month. **You** can put a stop to that by supporting our charity.

## How do I support this?
There are multiple ways you can do so. They include:
- Spamming `#CarrotsForDiTunes` in events, popular worlds, and test worlds made by developers. It is recommended to do so in front of MicChi. **Be sure to not spam at a too high rate, as you may get banned from the world. Recommended pace is 3 messages per minute.**
- Make signs/posters/walls saying `#CarrotsForDiTunes` in your worlds
- When near DiTunes you can give him a carrot, though it is unsure if MicChi will take it from him or not
- Annoy MicChi

## Krunkitis-22 Notice
If DiTunes is in a crowd, please refrain from giving him a carrot at this time. Instead, it is recommended to simply type `#CarrotsForDiTunes` in chat and wait until the crowd lessens.
